        Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth

        "Listen, now, you're going to die, Ray-mond K. K. K. Hessel, tonight.
        You might die in one second or in one hour, you decide. So lie to me.
        Tell me the first thing off the top of your head. Make something up. I
        don't give a shit. I have a gun.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, you were listening and coming out of the little tragedy in your
        head.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fill in the blank. What does Raymond Hessel want to be when he grows up?
        <br />
        <br />
        Go home, you said you just wanted to go home, please.
        <br />
        <br />
        No shit, I said. But after that, how did you want to spend your life? If
        you could do anything in the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Make something up.
        <br />
        <br />
        You didn't know.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then you're dead right now, I said. I said, now turn your head.
        <br />
        <br />
        Death to commence in ten, in nine, in eight.
        <br />
        <br />
        A vet, you said. You want to be a vet, a veterinarian.
        <br />
        <br />
        You could be in school working your ass off, Raymond Hessel, or you
        could be dead. You choose. I stuffed your wallet into the back of your
        jeans. So you really wanted to be an animal doctor. I took the saltwater
        muzzle of the gun off one cheek and pressed it against another. Is that
        what you've always wanted to be, Dr. Raymond K. K. K. K. Hessel, a
        veterinarian?...
        <br />
        <br />
        So, I said, go back to school. If you wake up tomorrow morning, you find
        a way to get back into school.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have your license.
        <br />
        <br />
        I know who you are. I know where you live. I'm keeping your license, and
        I'm going to check on you, mister Raymond K. Hessel. In three months,
        and then six months, and then a year, and if you aren't back in school
        on your way to being a veterinarian, you will be dead...
        <br />
        <br />
        Raymond K. K. Hessel, your dinner is going to taste better than any meal
        you've ever eaten, and tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of your
        life."
