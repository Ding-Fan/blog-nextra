# habits

> The Four Laws of Behavior Change are simple rules we can use to build better habits: (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.

I'm reading "Atomic Habits," where I've come to believe that maintaining a system, rather than aiming for specific goals, is beneficial. I've tried numerous methods to manage my habits, chores, and tasks: writing them down on paper, logging them in a calendar, using a single markdown file, setting reminders with a smart wristband, creating my own web application (just like every developer with their homemade todo-list), and trying various applications like Trello, Notion, and some unusual command-line todos. I've explored many methodologies, like the bento method, and even subscribed to a deprocrastination service.

Now, I think Habitica might be my thing. I enjoy gaming and understand that games are designed to be engaging and easy to stick with. I tried Habitica years ago, but at that time, it seemed like nothing more than a todo app with a Tamagotchi-like system. I wasn’t convinced by it. However, Habitica now seems promising, featuring habits, dailies, and todos. Currently, I use it as a logging system. I proactively input habits into Habitica, knowing that I often feel unsure about what to do, especially when I suddenly find myself with free time after work, school, or upon waking up. I'm also considering creating a script to modify Habitica’s UI, like enlarging the habit counter to make it more visually satisfying.

From "Atomic Habits," I learned:

Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The Four Laws of Behavior Change are simple rules we can use to build better habits: (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.

I can use Habitica to (2) make it attractive and (4) make it satisfying. To (3) make it easy, I describe each habit in Habitica in simple terms, like saying "put toothpaste on the toothbrush" instead of "brush my teeth", using language tricks to make it appear easy. However, due to the 'digital black hole,' Habitica won't show up unless I open it explicitly. So, I've decided to use paper and pen to make a simple schedule. For example, I draw a short timeline on paper, usually marked by 4 or 6 hours. Then, on the other half of the paper, I write down my todos, ordered as ABCD. I then loosely fill these into my timeline. These physical interactions (1) make it obvious. The timeline is always there, it is the cue.
