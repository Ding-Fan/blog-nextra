# create match three game

I'm trying to create a match three game with p5.js.

Firstly, I tried to use chatgpt to generate a workable game prototype. It has the grid and tiles, but not work well with the match and clear.

Now I'm trying to make gpt create a tile swap animation, it made the animation, but only part of it, and after the animation the second tile will become blank(white). I think I need to create this swap animation part by myself.
