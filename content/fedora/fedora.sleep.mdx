### Keep Your Fedora Laptop Running with the Lid Closed

By default, Fedora suspends your laptop when you close the lid to save power. To change this behavior—for instance, to keep music playing or downloads running—you should create a systemd configuration override.

**Do not edit `/usr/lib/systemd/logind.conf`.**

Instead, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a configuration file.**:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/
    sudo vi /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/lid.conf
    ```

2.  **Add your desired settings.** Paste the following into the file. You only need to specify the settings you wish to change.

    ```ini
    # This keeps the system running with the lid closed
    # when plugged into AC power, but suspends on battery.
    [Login]
    HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=lock
    HandleLidSwitch=suspend
    ```

      * `ignore`: Keeps the system running (screen off).
      * `suspend`: Puts the system to sleep.
      * `lock`: Locks the screen but keeps the system running.

3.  **Save the file and apply changes.**:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
    ```

Your new lid settings are now active.
