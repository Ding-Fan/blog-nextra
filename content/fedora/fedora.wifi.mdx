## 1. Open the File with `vi` ⚙️

Open a new configuration file in `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/` using `vi` with `sudo`.

sudo vi /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf
```

-----

## 2. Add the Configuration

```ini
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 2
```

## 3. Restart NetworkManager

Apply the new setting by restarting the NetworkManager service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
