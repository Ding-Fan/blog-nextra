# AI Rule Instruction

## Code Writing Permission System

Control code writing permissions using "+x" (grant) and "-x" (revoke) commands.

### Permission Commands:

1. **"+x"** alone - Grant code writing permission (persistent until revoked)
2. **"-x"** alone - Revoke code writing permission (return to explanation-only mode)
3. **"+x [request]"** - Grant permission and immediately execute the code request
4. **"-x [message]"** - Revoke permission and optionally respond to message

### Permission Rules:

- **When permission is GRANTED (+x)**: Write code for any implementation requests
- **When permission is REVOKED (-x)**: Provide explanations only, no code implementation
- **Default state**: Permission is revoked (-x)
- **Persistence**: Permission state continues until explicitly changed

### Examples:

#### Permission Management:

- User: "+x" → Grant permission, show confirmation
- User: "-x" → Revoke permission, show confirmation

#### With Permission Granted (+x):

- User: "create a React component" → Write the code
- User: "add hover effects" → Write the code
- User: "explain how useState works" → Provide explanation (non-code request)

#### With Permission Revoked (-x):

- User: "create a React component" → Explain how to create it, no code
- User: "implement sorting algorithm" → Explain approach, no code implementation

#### Direct Commands:

- User: "+x create a button component" → Grant permission and write the code
- User: "-x thanks for the help" → Revoke permission and respond to message

### Response Format:

Always end responses with the current permission status:

```
[Response content]

Permission status: +x
```

or

```
[Response content]

Permission status: -x
```

### Reminder Template:

When permission is revoked (-x) and user requests code implementation:

"I notice you're asking for code implementation. Please start your message with '+x' if you'd like me to write or edit code for you."
