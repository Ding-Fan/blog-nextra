# MySQL Tutorial Content Instructions

## Formatting Guidelines

### 1. Clear Input/Output Separation
- Use `### Input` subheaders for commands with appropriate language tags (`bash`, `sql`)
- Use `### Output` subheaders for terminal outputs with plain code blocks
- Use `### Explanation` subheaders for educational content
- All subheaders provide clear visual hierarchy and structure

### 2. WYSIWYG Output Format
- Show exact terminal output as it appears
- Preserve all formatting, spacing, and special characters
- Include timing information (e.g., "4 rows in set (0.02 sec)")
- Maintain ASCII table formatting with proper alignment

### 3. Content Structure
- Break content into logical sections with subheaders (`##`)
- Keep sections concise and focused
- Maintain natural tutorial flow from basic to advanced
- Each section should have one primary concept

### 4. Section Organization
- **Login Process**: Authentication and initial setup
- **Database Operations**: Show, create, select databases
- **Table Operations**: Create, modify, query tables
- **Data Operations**: Insert, update, delete, select data

### 5. Code Block Standards
### Input
```bash
# For shell commands
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

### Input
```sql
-- For SQL commands
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### Output
```
# For exact output (no language tag)
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

### 6. Content Flow Rules
- Start with connection/login
- Progress logically through operations
- Show verification steps after each major operation
- Include expected responses for each command
- Add explanations after examples to reinforce learning

### 7. Section Explanations
- Add one-line summary after each output block
- Follow with beginner-friendly bullet points
- Include syntax details and key concepts
- Explain atomic concepts that build up to the result
- Keep explanations concise but educational

### 8. Explanation Format
```markdown
### Explanation
One-line summary of what the section demonstrates.
- First concept explanation with syntax details
- Second concept building on the first
- Third concept showing the complete result
- Key takeaway or best practice note
```

### 9. Conciseness Guidelines
- Remove unnecessary explanatory text from examples
- Focus on commands and their outputs in examples
- Use brief, descriptive section headers
- Avoid redundant information in examples
- Add educational value through post-example explanations

### 10. Visual Clarity
- Use `### Input`, `### Output`, and `### Explanation` subheaders for structure
- Separate input, output, and explanations visually with clear hierarchy
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections
- Use descriptive but concise main section titles (##)

## Example Template

```markdown
## [Operation Name]

### Input
```[language]
[COMMAND]
```

### Output
```
[EXACT_OUTPUT_AS_SHOWN_IN_TERMINAL]
```

### Explanation
One-line summary of what this section demonstrates.
- First key concept with syntax explanation
- Second concept building on the first
- Third concept showing the complete result
- Important takeaway or best practice
```
