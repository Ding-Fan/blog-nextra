# MySQL Tutorial Content Instructions

## Formatting Guidelines

### 1. Clear Input/Output Separation
- Use distinct code blocks for commands and outputs
- Label commands with appropriate language tags (`bash`, `sql`)
- Mark outputs with **"Output:"** label followed by plain code blocks

### 2. WYSIWYG Output Format
- Show exact terminal output as it appears
- Preserve all formatting, spacing, and special characters
- Include timing information (e.g., "4 rows in set (0.02 sec)")
- Maintain ASCII table formatting with proper alignment

### 3. Content Structure
- Break content into logical sections with subheaders (`##`)
- Keep sections concise and focused
- Maintain natural tutorial flow from basic to advanced
- Each section should have one primary concept

### 4. Section Organization
- **Login Process**: Authentication and initial setup
- **Database Operations**: Show, create, select databases
- **Table Operations**: Create, modify, query tables
- **Data Operations**: Insert, update, delete, select data

### 5. Code Block Standards
```bash
# For shell commands
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

```sql
-- For SQL commands
SHOW DATABASES;
```

```
# For exact output (no language tag)
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

### 6. Content Flow Rules
- Start with connection/login
- Progress logically through operations
- Show verification steps after each major operation
- Include expected responses for each command

### 7. Conciseness Guidelines
- Remove unnecessary explanatory text
- Focus on commands and their outputs
- Use brief, descriptive section headers
- Avoid redundant information

### 8. Visual Clarity
- Use **bold** for output labels
- Separate input and output visually
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections
- Use descriptive but concise section titles

## Example Template

```markdown
## [Operation Name]

```[language]
[COMMAND]
```

**Output:**
```
[EXACT_OUTPUT_AS_SHOWN_IN_TERMINAL]
```
```
