# Programming Basics (Java)

### Integer: 整数　せいすう

- A whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero, without any fractional or decimal parts.
- Example: `42`, `-15`, `0`, `1000`

### Decimal: 小数　しょうすう

- Any numeral value that consists of a decimal point is a decimal number.
- Example: `3.14`, `2.5`, `0.001`, `10.0`

### Create a Variable

```java showLineNumbers
int apple;
```

- `int` means "this is an integer"
- `apple` is the name of the variable
- `;` is the end of the statement, indicating that this line of code is complete
- `int apple;` creates a variable named `apple` of type `int` (integer).

### Assign a Value to a Variable

```java showLineNumbers {3}
int apple;

apple = 2;
```

- `apple` is the variable we created earlier.
- `=` is the assignment operator, "put the right side value into the left side"
- `2` is the value being assigned to the variable `apple`.
- `;` is the end of the statement, indicating that this line of code is complete

### Use a Variable

```java showLineNumbers {5}
int apple;

apple = 2;

System.out.println( apple );
```

- `System.out.println(apple);` prints the value of the variable `apple` to the console
- this time we use `apple` without `int` because we are using the variable, not creating it
- actually, when we assign `2` to `apple` at line 3, we are also using it
- To sum up
  - Line 1: we create a variable named `apple` of type `int`
  - Line 3: we assign the value `2` to the variable `apple`
  - Line 5: we use the variable `apple` to print its value to the console

Try to create a variable named `orange` and assign it the value `5`, then print it to the console.

### Create a Variable and Assign a Value to It in One Line

```java showLineNumbers
int banana = 2;
```

This is an important pattern.

```bash
[data type] [variable name] [assignment operator] [value] [semicolon]
```

- Create an **integer** variable
- **named** banana
- **assign** it the
- **value** 2
- end

Try to use this pattern, then print it to the console.

- ` ` can you see the space? It makes the code more readable.

### Integer Types: 整数型　せいすうがた 

- Integer types are `byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long`.

### Floating Point Types(Decimal): 浮動小数点　ふどうしょうすうてん 小数　しょうすう

- Floating point (Decimal) types are `float` and `double`.

### Primitive Type

- A data type that is not composed of other data types.
- All the primitive types in Java are:

  - `byte` - 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
  - `short` - 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
  - `int` - 32-bit signed integer (-2³¹ to 2³¹-1)
  - `long` - 64-bit signed integer (-2⁶³ to 2⁶³-1)
  - `float` - 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
  - `double` - 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
  - `boolean` - `true` or `false`
  - `char` - 16-bit Unicode character ('\u0000' to '\uffff')

- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html

### Reference Type

- A data type that refers to an object or an instance of a class.
- Example: `String`, `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Integer`

### Operator

- A symbol that performs operations on variables and values.

#### Arithmetic Operators: 算術演算子　さんじゅつえんざんし

- `+` - Addition (加算　かさん): `5 + 3 = 8`
- `-` - Subtraction (減算　げんざん): `5 - 3 = 2`
- `*` - Multiplication (乗算　じょうざん): `5 * 3 = 15`
- `/` - Division (除算　じょざん): `15 / 3 = 5`
- `%` - Modulo (剰余　じょうよ): `15 % 4 = 3`

#### Comparison Operators: 比較演算子　ひかくえんざんし

- `==` - Equal to (等しい　ひとしい): `5 == 5` returns `true`
- `!=` - Not equal to (等しくない　ひとしくない): `5 != 3` returns `true`
- `<` - Less than (より小さい　よりちいさい): `3 < 5` returns `true`
- `>` - Greater than (より大きい　よりおおきい): `5 > 3` returns `true`
- `<=` - Less than or equal to: `3 <= 5` returns `true`
- `>=` - Greater than or equal to: `5 >= 5` returns `true`

#### Logical Operators: 論理演算子　ろんりえんざんし

- `&&` - AND (論理積　ろんりせき): `true && false` returns `false`
- `||` - OR (論理和　ろんりわ): `true || false` returns `true`
- `!` - NOT (否定　ひてい): `!true` returns `false`

#### Assignment Operators: 代入演算子　だいにゅうえんざんし

- `=` - Assignment (代入　だいにゅう): `int x = 5;`
- `+=` - Add and assign: `x += 3` (same as `x = x + 3`)
- `-=` - Subtract and assign: `x -= 2` (same as `x = x - 2`)
- `*=` - Multiply and assign: `x *= 4` (same as `x = x * 4`)
- `/=` - Divide and assign: `x /= 2` (same as `x = x / 2`)

#### Increment/Decrement: 増減演算子　ぞうげんえんざんし

- `++` - Increment (増加　ぞうか): `x++` or `++x` (adds 1)
- `--` - Decrement (減少　げんしょう): `x--` or `--x` (subtracts 1)


What is the difference between `++i` and `i++`?

The key insight is that **both always increment the variable** , but they differ in **what value they return to be used** in the surrounding expression.

- `++i`: "Increment i, then give me the result"
- `i++`: "Give me i's current value, then increment i"

Try this example:

```java copy
int i = 5;
System.out.println(++i);  // Prints: 6 (i is now 6)

int j = 5;
System.out.println(j++);  // Prints: 5 (j becomes 6 after printing)
```

### ASCII code

- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that uses numbers to represent characters.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII

In the old days, computers can only display characters, like the command line(terminal) in your computer. That is CLI(Command Line Interface).

- https://youtu.be/VStscvYLYLs?t=11

Computer only understand 0 and 1, so people create a table, use a number to represent a character

Find the character of these: `76 48 86 101`

In this ascii table

- https://www.ascii-code.com/

The answer is `L 0 V e`

What if I want a red heart? ❤️

It is in the unicode `U+2764`

- https://symbl.cc/en/2764-red-heart-emoji/

Unicode is a superset of ASCII . You can see in this unicode table

- https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#basic-latin

`76 48 86 101` is also `L 0 V e`

### ASCII Art

In CLI, People do things like this:

```bash
# User type this
echo "Hello!"

# Computer displays this
Hello!
```

It's boring! Then some programmer created a program called `cowsay`

```bash
# User type this
cowsay "Hello!"

# Computer displays this
 ________
< Hello! >
 --------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

### ASCII Game

Are you a gamer? Do you want to play game in CLI with full screen of ASCII characters?

### UI(User Interface)

User Interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. For example, when you use "google search", you talk to "google search" by typing into the input box, and it talks back to you by displaying the search results on the screen. What you see and interact with is the UI.

### API(Application Programming Interface)

### CSV(Comma-Separated Values)

Let's say I have 2 red apples, 4 green apples, 3 yellow bananas, 6 black bananas. I want to use a text file to store it.  

```csv
fruit  , color  , quantity
apple  , red    , 2
apple  , green  , 4
banana , yellow , 3
banana , black  , 6
```

There is a table header, containing 3 columns: "fruit", "color", and "quantity". 

Below that are several rows of data. This entire file is separated by commas, and new line for each row.

This is a CSV file. This is a readable table. And yes, you can import it into a spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

The closest documentation for CSV is the [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180#page-2)
