# idea

- VR music festival, NFT ticket

- XR tomagochi
  - the bare eye 3d looks cool but not convinced me as a product
  - the box with NFC, user can touch NFC tag to trigger dialogue, based on local time, NFC tag can be key holder or other goods
  - NFC tag to change costume
  - when figure need care, need water or whatever, will show animation based on current situation, just like click the paperclip from MS office
  - box as home of character, use phone to take them out, back to home to restore health, take out to improve happiness
