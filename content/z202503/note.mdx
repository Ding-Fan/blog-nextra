- get my water heater fixed
  - Friday night, trying to start shower, let the water run for a while, no hot water
  - Saturday morning, during teeth brushing, make the water running, still no hot water. Contact the estate agent, explain that water heater is not working, send the picture and video of the water heater under request from the estate agent, find the official repair service call-line from manual downloaded from the internet, send the phone number to estate agent.
  - Sunday afternoon, got a call from the repair service, appointed a time for Monday morning to fix the water heater.
  - Monday morning, missed the call from the repair service, call back, reschedule the appointment to noon. Call the electricity company to turn on the power of the water heater temporarily(because it was set only work in night to use the cheap electricity price). The repair service came, find out the safe switch inside the water heater is off, turn it on. Tell me check the water temperature in the evening because it takes time to heat up.
  - Monday evening, check the water temperature, it's hot.
