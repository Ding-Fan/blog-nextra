## [In Praise of 'Normal' Engineers](https://spectrum.ieee.org/10x-engineer)

**Detailed Summary:**

In the article "In Praise of 'Normal' Engineers," Charity Majors, cofounder and CTO of Honeycomb.io, challenges the myth of the "10x engineer"—the notion that certain engineers are ten times more productive than their peers. She argues that productivity is not an inherent trait but is highly context-dependent; an engineer may excel in one area while being average in others. Majors emphasizes that software development is a collective endeavor where teams, not individuals, own the software. Therefore, the focus should be on enhancing overall team performance rather than relying on standout individuals. She advocates for building inclusive, high-performing teams where all engineers can contribute effectively, asserting that the hallmark of a great engineering organization is its ability to empower "normal" engineers to achieve significant impact. citeturn0search0
