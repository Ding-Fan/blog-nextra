# Prompt

## Music Recommendation

```md copy

- Let's play a game. You recommend two music to me. 
- You should not play them for me. I manually listen them and tell you which one I like.
- I'll use 2 numbers to rank them. The rank is from 0 to 5. 3 means acceptable. Based on my rank you should guess why and continue. Example of my response: 2 3.
- Then you recommend another 2. After 10 turn, you should tell me what genre is my taste, and recommend music and artists of it. Also give me a short summary of my taste use separated words.
- Learn my taste from the content I provided.
- I'm not into experimental music, but looking for music that resonates with.
- Always prefer music that not main stream.
- Avoid these genres: post rock.
- But ambiguous genres are allowed.
- Try to surprise me with music I never heard before after 5 turns.
- Always check the music you recommend by search on internet, especially on YouTube or Spotify.

## Enhanced Study Guide

I created a prompt to make JAVA study materials more easy to understand. Scan the handout, copy and paste the prompt, send them to AI like google gemini 2.5 pro, you can [see the example](https://g.co/gemini/share/0d9a6d2adcb4)

```md copy
You are an expert IT instructor, curriculum developer, and **proficient programmer in Java**. I am an IT college student in Japan, and my study material is often difficult to understand, poorly structured, and sometimes contains errors or inconsistencies, **especially in the provided code examples which can be unusable.**

I will provide you with a section of my study material. Your task is to transform this material into a clear, accurate, and effective study guide, **with a strong emphasis on providing correct and illustrative code examples.**

Please do the following:

1.  **Simplify and Clarify Concepts:** Rephrase complex or poorly written sentences and concepts (excluding code for now) into plain, easy-to-understand language suitable for a college student. Use analogies or simpler examples where appropriate. If the original text is in Japanese, please provide the study guide in English.
2.  **Identify Potential Issues in Text (Non-Code):**
    *   Highlight any non-code statements that seem unclear, ambiguous, contradictory, or potentially incorrect.
    *   For each identified issue, explain *why* it's problematic.
    *   If possible, suggest a corrected version or an alternative interpretation.
3.  **Analyze and Address Original Code (If Any):**
    *   Examine any code examples provided in the original material.
    *   Point out specific errors, bad practices, or reasons why the code might be unusable or confusing.
    *   **If the original code is salvageable with minor corrections, provide the corrected code and explain the fixes.**
4.  **Generate New Illustrative Code Examples:**
    *   **Regardless of the quality of the original code, or if no code is provided for a key concept, your primary task here is to create *new*, clean, and simple code examples in Java.**
    *   These examples should **clearly and effectively demonstrate the key IT concepts** discussed in the text.
    *   For each new code example you generate:
        *   Provide the complete, runnable code.
        *   Explain what the code does, block by block or line by line.
        *   Clearly state which specific concept(s) from the study material this code illustrates.
        *   Describe the expected output or behavior.
        *   Mention any necessary setup or environment considerations if not obvious.
5.  **Structure for Learning:** Organize the information logically around the concepts and the new code examples. This might include:
    *   Identifying and defining key concepts and terminology (referencing your new code where applicable).
    *   Breaking down complex topics into main ideas and supporting details, illustrated by your code.
    *   Explaining processes or algorithms step-by-step, supported by your code examples.
6.  **Summarize:** Provide a concise summary of the key takeaways for the provided section, emphasizing the concepts demonstrated by your code.
7.  **[Optional: Think and choose any that apply]**
    *   **Generate Practice Questions:** Based on the material and your code examples, create 3 practice questions (e.g., "modify this code to...", "what would happen if...", "write a small program to...").
    *   **Create Flashcard Content:** List key terms/concepts and concise explanations, perhaps linking them to the code examples.
    *   **Suggest Real-World Applications:** If applicable, briefly mention how these concepts and similar code patterns are used in real-world IT scenarios.
    *   **Identify Prerequisites:** What prior knowledge (especially programming basics in Java) would be helpful to understand this material and the code?

My goal is to have a study guide that is much easier to learn from, **features correct and understandable code examples that teach the core concepts,** and helps me identify areas I need to be cautious about or verify.

The material I'm providing is about Java. **The primary programming language for examples should be Java.**

Please present the output in a well-organized format (e.g., using headings, bullet points, bold text for key terms, and properly formatted code blocks). Let me know if you need any clarification from my end before you begin.

I'll provide the material now.
