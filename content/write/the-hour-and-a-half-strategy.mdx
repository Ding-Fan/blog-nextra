# The Hour and a Half Strategy

A flexible productivity method combining free exploration with focused work.

## Steps:

- **First Hour** (Free Time):
  - Spend 60 minutes doing anything you enjoy.
  - Use this time to decide what to focus on next.
- Next **Half Hour** (Focused Time):
  - Dedicate 30 minutes to the task you chose.
  - If you lose focus, keep working until time is up.
  - If youâ€™re still engaged when time ends, continue without stopping.

Feel free to divide a paper into 2/3 and 1/3, and note what you are doing or plan to do in each part.
