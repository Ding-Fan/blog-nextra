# Write Blog

I've been using AI to generate code and stories. But I feel I need to write with my own brain. Maybe I can just write down whatever comes to my mind.

I feel that my English grammar and spelling are getting worse. AI can understand everything I sent, and I'll get lazy to fix my mistakes. I need to create a system to help me learn by practicing.

Personalized learning with AI.

SPI is the Japanese way to evaluate the ability of a candidate, on one hand it does ensure the candidate has decent communication skills, can solve basic math and logic problems, on the other hand it is limited to Japanese language. A non-native Japanese speaker is at a disadvantage even if they are fluent in Japanese. In the CCNA exam, [time extension](https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-takers/accommodations/pearson_approve.cisco.html) is guarenteed to non-native English speakers so they can have extra 30 minutes. In IELTS exam, [special arrangements](https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/take-ielts/book/special-arrangements/learning-difficulties) are given to user have difficulties like ADHD. 

SPI takers are urging to have a good score to get a job, so some of them are facing a moral dilemma: cheat or fail. There are services that provide answers to SPI questions, or even hire someone to take the exam for you, or just use AI. This is leading to Gresham's law: "bad money drives out good money". Those who cheat will be active in the job market, while those honest people have no ways to compete and ends up left Japan.

The recruitment side have to figure out how to evaluate candidates without SPI. And use the advantage of multilingual candidates.
