# MySQL Tutorial Content Instructions

## Formatting Guidelines

### 1. Clear Input/Output Separation
- Use `### Input` subheaders for commands with appropriate language tags (`bash`, `sql`)
- Use `### Output` subheaders for terminal outputs with plain code blocks
- Use `### Explanation` subheaders for educational content
- All subheaders provide clear visual hierarchy and structure

### 2. WYSIWYG Output Format
- Show exact terminal output as it appears
- Preserve all formatting, spacing, and special characters
- Include timing information (e.g., "4 rows in set (0.02 sec)")
- Maintain ASCII table formatting with proper alignment

### 3. Content Structure
- Break content into logical sections with subheaders (`##`)
- Keep sections concise and focused
- Maintain natural tutorial flow from basic to advanced
- Each section should have one primary concept

### 4. Section Organization
- **Login Process**: Authentication and initial setup
- **Database Operations**: Show, create, select databases
- **Table Operations**: Create, modify, query tables
- **Data Operations**: Insert, update, delete, select data

### 5. Code Block Standards
### Input
```bash
# For shell commands
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

### Input
```sql
-- For SQL commands
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### Output
```
# For exact output (no language tag)
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

### 6. Content Flow Rules
- Start with connection/login
- Progress logically through operations
- Show verification steps after each major operation
- Include expected responses for each command
- Add explanations after examples to reinforce learning

### 7. Section Explanations
- Add one-line summary after each output block
- Follow with beginner-friendly bullet points
- Include syntax details and key concepts
- Explain atomic concepts that build up to the result
- Keep explanations concise but educational

### 8. Explanation Format
```markdown
### Explanation
One-line summary of what the section demonstrates.
- First key concept with syntax explanation
- Second concept building on the first
- Third concept showing the complete result
- Important takeaway or best practice
```

### 9. Conciseness Guidelines
- Remove unnecessary explanatory text from examples
- Focus on commands and their outputs in examples
- Use brief, descriptive section headers
- Avoid redundant information in examples
- Add educational value through post-example explanations

### 10. Visual Clarity
- Use `### Input`, `### Output`, and `### Explanation` subheaders for structure
- Separate input, output, and explanations visually with clear hierarchy
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections
- Use descriptive but concise main section titles (##)

### 11. Handling Unformatted Content

When encountering unformatted content mixed with properly formatted sections:

#### Identification
- Look for raw SQL commands without `### Input` headers
- Find output blocks without `### Output` headers
- Spot missing `### Explanation` sections
- Notice inconsistent spacing or structure

#### Reformatting Process
1. **Group Related Commands**: Identify commands that demonstrate the same concept
2. **Create Section Headers**: Use descriptive `##` headers for each concept group
3. **Structure Each Example**: Apply the Input/Output/Explanation pattern
4. **Maintain Output Fidelity**: Preserve exact terminal output formatting
5. **Add Educational Content**: Create explanations that build understanding

#### Common Unformatted Patterns
```markdown
# BEFORE (unformatted)
SELECT prod_name FROM Products WHERE price > 10;
+----------+
| prod_name|
+----------+
| Product 1|
+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

# AFTER (formatted)
## Filter by Price

### Input
```sql
SELECT prod_name FROM Products WHERE price > 10;
```

### Output
```
+----------+
| prod_name|
+----------+
| Product 1|
+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

### Explanation
Filters products by price using comparison operators.
- WHERE clause restricts results to rows meeting specified conditions
- Greater than operator (>) finds values above the threshold
- Results show only products priced above $10
```

#### Multiple Related Examples
When multiple commands demonstrate the same concept:
- Group them under one section header
- Use multiple Input/Output pairs within the same section
- Provide one comprehensive Explanation covering all examples
- Show progression from simple to complex usage

#### Special Characters in Markdown
- Escape HTML entities: `&lt;=` for `<=`, `&gt;=` for `>=`
- Use proper code formatting to avoid MDX parsing issues
- Test that all content renders correctly

## Content Recovery Guidelines

### 12. Working with Mixed Format Content

#### Assessment Phase
1. **Scan for Patterns**: Identify where formatting breaks down
2. **Find Natural Breaks**: Look for logical concept boundaries
3. **Preserve Learning Flow**: Maintain tutorial progression
4. **Identify Missing Context**: Note gaps in explanations

#### Restructuring Strategy
1. **Start from Last Properly Formatted Section**: Continue from known good state
2. **Process in Logical Groups**: Handle related commands together
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Apply established formatting patterns
4. **Cross-Reference Content**: Ensure examples align with explanations

#### Content Organization
- **Conceptual Grouping**: Commands teaching the same principle belong together
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple examples before complex ones
- **Verification Steps**: Include commands that confirm operations worked
- **Error Handling**: Show both successful and error cases when relevant

## Example Template

```markdown
## [Operation Name]

### Input
```[language]
[COMMAND]
```

### Output
```
[EXACT_OUTPUT_AS_SHOWN_IN_TERMINAL]
```

### Explanation
One-line summary of what this section demonstrates.
- First key concept with syntax explanation
- Second concept building on the first
- Third concept showing the complete result
- Important takeaway or best practice
```
