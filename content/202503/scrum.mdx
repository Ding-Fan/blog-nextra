# Scrum

> AI summary:
- Different team members view daily stand-ups differently: beginners find them useful for quick updates and help, while experienced members often see less benefit.  
- These meetings catch problems early and keep everyone informed, reducing the need for long formal sessions.  
- Sometimes, stand-ups become too long or uninteresting, especially when there isn’t much to share.  
- They don't have to happen every day—it's better to focus on solving problems and planning ahead rather than just sharing past progress.  
- The key to effective meetings is to adjust them to fit the team's needs and regularly check if they are working well.

## [Are Daily Stand-up Meetings Valuable? A Survey of Developers in Software Teams](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-57633-6_20)

- Among agile teams, DSMs are widely adopted, though their perceived value significantly varies.  
- Junior developers view DSMs positively for the relevant information and problem-solving assistance they receive.  
- Senior developers tend to rate DSMs lower, as they work on complex, independent tasks that are not well-served by daily updates.  
- In larger teams, where tasks are loosely coupled, DSMs are often seen as less valuable because the shared information may not be immediately applicable.  
- The study emphasizes that DSM effectiveness should be assessed based on team needs rather than individual perspectives, urging senior developers to acknowledge the broader benefits for the team.  
- Future research is recommended to explore role-specific and domain-specific factors that influence DSM perceptions, especially in large-team settings.

- Advantages:
  - Reduce the need for lengthy, formal meetings.
  - Enable early detection and resolution of issues with regular updates.

- Disadvantages:
  - Meetings can become longer and more formal than intended.
  - Too many participants may lead to inefficiencies and poor communication.
  - Some updates may be performative rather than fostering genuine collaboration.
  - In projects with minimal daily progress, meetings might be unnecessary.
  - Fixed meeting times can disrupt flexible work schedules.

- Overall Insight:
  - Daily stand-ups can be effective for communication and early problem-solving when tailored to the specific needs of the team.

## [The Daily Stand-Up Meeting: A Grounded Theory Study](https://sintef.brage.unit.no/sintef-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2478996/JSS_2016_Stray_Sj%C3%B8berg_Dyb%C3%A5.pdf?sequence=1)

- Most existing views on Daily Stand-up Meetings (DSMs) are based on anecdotal evidence.  
- The study conducted a grounded theory analysis of twelve agile teams across three companies.  
- DSM participants, on average, were almost neutral, with slightly more satisfaction than dissatisfaction.  
- Despite DSMs seeming simple to implement, they involve complexities that affect meeting attitudes.  
- Two key positive factors:  
 - Team members gain an overview of what others are doing.  
 - DSMs provide an opportunity for discussing and solving problems.  
- Two key negative factors:  
 - Reporting status progress led to disengagement due to irrelevance for some team members and discomfort with reporting.  
 - DSMs often took up too much time relative to the benefits gained from the meetings.  
- The findings suggest that DSMs do not necessarily need to be held daily and should focus more on discussing issues, solving problems, and future planning rather than merely reporting past progress.  
- A grounded theory of DSMs was proposed, consisting of seven constructs and six propositions.  
- A modified set of guidelines was recommended to help overcome the identified negative factors, urging companies to evaluate and continuously improve their DSM practices.  
- The paper also contributes a detailed description of conducting a grounded theory study in the context of agile methods, addressing the scarcity of such research in software engineering.


## Me

I think for the daily communication, I prefer an asynchronous system, like a Kanban board in Linear. I might be able to join the daily meeting in March, but once school starts I won't be able to attend.
