# Mac System Data

> [So I removed the files form "/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd/Customer" but it keeps getting downloading back. Is there any way to stop the downloads?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/16vf5nv/comment/kj8wy9q)

My Mac suddenly ran out of storage space. In the "System Settings" > "General" > "Storage", "System Data" was over 100GB.

Found the issue: "Wallpaper" at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd` downloaded tons of 4K 240fps videos.

1. Turn off the "Wallpaper" feature in System Settings, I set the pure black color as the wallpaper.
2. Delete these files

```sh
/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd/
/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TVIdleScreen/
${HOME}/Library/Application Support/com.apple.wallpaper/Store/Index.plist
```

3. Restart the Mac.

Storage space recovered.
