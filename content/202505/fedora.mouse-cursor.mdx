# Fix mouse cursor size on fedora


to fix the scale bug, try this, and reboot to see if it works

```bash
# in ~/.bashrc
export XCURSOR_SIZE=48
```

install xeyes
With xeyes, if it's an X11 window, the "eyes" will move with mouse, otherwise it's wayland. 

Install cursor theme might fix the cursor scale bug
browse cursors theme [here](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse?cat=107&ord=latest)
install Fluent cursor theme from [github](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-icon-theme) via `sudo ./install.sh`
install Polarnight cursor theme from [github](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/Polarnight-Cursors) via `sudo ./install.sh`
but I don't know how to change the cursor theme in gnome-tweaks
