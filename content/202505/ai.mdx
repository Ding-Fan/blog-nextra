    - Plan first
    - write code with specific explict permission
    - do it step by step, save with git commit
    - use cheaper AI models(not work for me though)

Trying to work with AI to create a ruby on rails comment system.

1. Use google ai studio, gemini 2.5 pro, turn on grounding. Discuss about the project, generate a PRD(Product Requirement Document).
2. Use VSCode insider with github copilor student free tier. Use ask mode. Feed it the PRD. It responds with a suggestion of file structure. Tell it I want to create it by hand.
3. it says:

```bash
rails new comment-system-api --api --database=postgresql
cd comment-system-api
```

Search online, find the ruby on rails documentation [The Rails Command Line](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html).

Install ruby on rails via nix-darwin. Seems not good. Read some resources:

I've spent one month on NixOS and didn't get the input method/xwayland/niri/waybar work as I expected. Maybe it is not wise to dig in "how to install rails use Nix" instead of creating the product I need right now. I should focus on build.

Let's just `gem install rails`.

Nah, it doesn't work. Follow the official [install_ruby_on_rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html#install-ruby-on-macos), we could use...

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/demo.html)

Wow!

Install these with nix `openssl_3 libyaml gmp rustc`

Official [mise guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#nix) is ambigious.

Searched on Github, trying to follow [example by skyblue-jpn](https://github.com/search?q=repo:skyblue-jpn/.dotfiles%20mise&type=code) to install mise with nix.

Add `mise-flake.url = "github:jdx/mise";` to flake.nix inputs and outputs=inputs@.

It works! Wait... mise is just for install ruby, not rails. It also [use bundle](https://mise.jdx.dev/mise-cookbook/ruby.html#a-ruby-on-rails-project) to handle rails.

Back to start.

I have devenv installed. Maybe try to use it.

Maybe this is not a good idea, the scaffold is too complex. Docker might be better.

Decide to use nix-shell to install temporary rails, and create the project with docker. Then use that docker to work on the project.

```bash
# start the nix-shell
nix-shell -p git curl openssl_3 libyaml postgresql bundler ruby_3_4.withPackages'(ps: [ps.rails])'

# check ruby version
ruby --version

# check rails version
rails --version

# https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#creating-a-rails-app
rails new --help

# Let's create it!
# https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/ruby-on-rails
rails new rails-comment --database=postgresql
```

Successfully created the project, but the dockerfile says it is for production, not development.

Install docker [the non-nix way](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Docker#Running_the_docker_daemon_from_nix-the-package-manager_-_not_NixOS) .

I installed [orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) . But maybe nothing to do with it yet?

I asked github copilot claude 3.7, created dockerfile.dev, dockerfile.prod, docker-compose.yml

And decided to use postgresql image as the database for now. It might be easier for development localy.

And use these commands:

```bash
# run the docker container
docker-compose up

# stop the docker container
docker-compose down

# build it without cache when debugging
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

It's working!
