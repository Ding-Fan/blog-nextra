# airi

Try to run airi on my little laptop, again.

```bash
# clone it
git clone git@github.com:moeru-ai/airi.git

# install dependencies
cd airi
pnpm i

# maybe need: build to fix jiti
pnpm packages:build

# run it
pnpm apps:web:dev
# this is not recommended
# pnpm dev

```

Set API_KEY in Settings - Providers. I use Google Gemini.

In Modules - Consciousness, set Gemini and models/gemini-2.0-flash
