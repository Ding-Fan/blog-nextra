# java subnetwork

Let's say here is an ip address: 192.168.10.8/24

From the first octet, we can see that:

- this is a class C address
- the default subnet mask of class C address is /24.
- from the ip address we can see that the subnet mask is /24.
- So this network doesn't have any subnetworks, or it has only one network.
- the network address is 192.168.10.0
- the broadcast address is 192.168.10.255
- the range of ip addresses is 192.168.10.1 - 192.168.10.254
- can have maximum 254 hosts(devices) in this network.

## class of ip address

The class of an ip address is determined by the first octet of the ip address.

- Class A: 1-126
  - which is 00000001-01111110
- Class B: 128-191
  - which is 10000000-10111111
- Class C: 192-223
  - which is 11000000-11011111
- Class D: 224-239
  - which is 11100000-11101111
- Class E: 240-255
  - which is 11110000-11111111
