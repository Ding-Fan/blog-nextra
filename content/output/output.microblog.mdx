[Hotel California | Pocket Operator Version](https://youtu.be/2jdNQZsHmk4)

A sleepless night. There was a man in jeans, not too old, not too young, with his framed glasses and unshaved beard, so geeky. Sitting with folding legs on the floor. 

Several unknown electronic devices in front of him, looks like circuit boards torn from old mini calculators, placed in a mysterious order, wired together. 

He is dancing, shaking his head and folded legs. Moving his hands in the air, down to the buttons on circuit boards, forth and back. Music and God were following his glowing finger, Hotel California, but in the dream of an arcade machine.

He recorded a YouTube video, I'm watching it, looped.

AI never won.
