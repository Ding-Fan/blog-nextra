# Prompt

**Task:** Extract structured data from the provided source and format it as CSV.

**Source:** [URL or describe PDF content], and do your research online to verify the status and supplement details (like salary or location specifics) for the jobs found at the source.

Proposed CSV Schema (Columns/data fields):
company_name: The name of the company offering the job. (This will be repeated for each opening from the same company).
job_title: The specific title of the position (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Marketing Manager", "Data Analyst").
job_id (Optional but Recommended): If the website provides a unique ID for the opening, capture it. This helps differentiate similar titles.
location: The location(s) where the job is based (e.g., "Tokyo, Japan", "Osaka or Remote", "Remote (US)"). You might consider splitting this further later if needed (e.g., city, state, country, remote_status).
employment_type: Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Internship, etc.
department (Optional): The department or team the role belongs to (e.g., "Engineering", "Sales", "Cloud Division").
salary_min: The minimum salary offered (numeric value, if specified). Leave blank or use N/A if only a range or non-numeric value is given.
salary_max: The maximum salary offered (numeric value, if specified). If a single salary is given, you could put the same value in salary_min and salary_max. Leave blank or use N/A otherwise.
salary_currency: The currency of the salary (e.g., JPY, USD, EUR).
salary_period: The period the salary covers (e.g., Annual, Monthly, Hourly).
salary_notes: A text field to capture salary details that don't fit the numeric columns (e.g., "Competitive", "Based on experience", "Plus bonus", the original text range like "$70,000 - $90,000").
job_description_summary (Optional): A brief summary or key responsibilities/requirements.
job_url: The direct URL to the specific job posting page.
date_posted (Optional): If the posting date is available.

**Output Requirements:**
1.  First, provide a textual summary of the findings.
2.  Then, create the CSV.
3.  Use nothing for fields where information could not be found.
