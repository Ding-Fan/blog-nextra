## MCP

我现在其实很想做一件事，纸上画一周的日历，然后弄个靠谱 OCR （不知道 Qwen 如何），接上 MCP 直接导进 Google Calendar

我最近刚跑通一个 MCP ，甚至花了 0.02 美金的 credit 去测试

我：向我问好

- 您的代码的确有些问题，xxxx（然后把我本来正确的 MCP 语法改成错的）
  我：（拒绝它的修改请求）我现在在测试 MCP,我已经写好了，没问题，我需要你向我问好
- （沉思，用户说要我测试它的 MCP...）请求调用问好 tool ，是否同意？
  我：同意
- 你好%20 某某

我现在手机端一般这么用 AI

- 打开 edge 浏览器，打开 AI 网页点击输入框
- 用输入法的语音输入说一堆内容，打字太慢限制思维
- 直接发送，然后看 AI 输出什么
- 如果输出完了，用 edge 浏览器自带的文字转语音念给我听

Prompt for cursor:

you should learn from your past mistakes and avoid them.

### SNS Timeline from Book by AI

Concept Overview:
The idea is to create a social networking service (SNS) timeline that is generated from the content of a book using AI. This would allow users to experience the narrative of a book in a dynamic, interactive format similar to a social media feed.
Features:

1. AI-Powered Content Extraction: Use AI to analyze the book's text and extract key events, character interactions, and plot developments.
2. Timeline Generation: Convert these extracted elements into a timeline format, presenting them as posts, updates, or messages.
3. Interactive Elements: Allow users to comment, like, or share these posts, creating a community around the book's content.
4. Character Profiles: Develop profiles for characters, enabling users to follow their stories and interactions as if they were real people.
5. Multimedia Integration: Incorporate images, videos, or audio clips related to the book's content to enhance the experience.

Potential Benefits:

- Engagement: Increases reader engagement by presenting the book in a familiar, interactive format.
- Accessibility: Makes complex narratives more accessible by breaking them down into digestible updates.
- Community Building: Fosters a community of readers who can discuss and interact with the book's content in real-time.

Challenges:

- Content Accuracy: Ensuring the AI accurately captures and represents the book's content.
- Copyright Issues: Navigating the legal aspects of using book content in this format.
- User Experience: Designing an intuitive and engaging user interface.

Next Steps:

- Research existing technologies for text analysis and timeline generation.
- Explore partnerships with publishers or authors for content access.
- Develop a prototype to test the concept with a small user group.
