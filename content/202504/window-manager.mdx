# window manager

## Paper WM Spoon Mac

  - https://github.com/mogenson/PaperWM.spoon
  - Give up on it. Has bugs when drag application window to different workspaces.

## amethyst

  - A tiling window manager for macOS
  - https://ianyh.com/amethyst/
  - don't know how to switch between workspaces
## AeroSpace

  - AeroSpace is an i3-like tiling window manager for macOS
    - no need to use native workspace anymore
  - https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace?tab=readme-ov-file
  - difficult to indicate the current active window
    - https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/85
      - Even the darkest macOS hackers (in a good sense ðŸ˜„ ) decided to drop this functionality in yabai, because it's impossible to maintain
    - maybe use https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders as a workaround
      - might have bugs https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders/issues/154
    - using [5.2. 'on-focus-changed' callbacks](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#on-focus-changed-callbacks) to track window focus
  - In "Desktop & Dock", turn on the "Group windows by application" to make mission control show windows in a pleasant way
