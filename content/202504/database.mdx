# database

3 of 200 yen apples, 2 of 150 yen bread, 8 of 100 yen coffee

We use tables to store data. Like a spreadsheet, Excel on Windows or Google Sheets, or Numbers on Mac.

## flat-file database

A text file to store data in plain text.

### Comma separated values (CSV)

Store the data line by line, with each line representing a record. Each field is separated by a comma.

```csv
amount,price,name
3,200,Apple
2,150,Bread
8,100,Coffee
```

The first line, or first row, is the header. It defines the name of each column.

## relational database

Definition: A database that stores data in tables, with relationships between the tables.

Usually you can import CSV files into a relational database.

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL (pronounced "sequel" or "S-Q-L") is a language used to communicate with relational databases. It is used to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data in the database.
