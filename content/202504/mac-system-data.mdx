# Mac System Data

My Mac suddenly ran out of storage space. In the "System Settings" > "General" > "Storage", "System Data" was over 100GB.

Found the issue: "Wallpaper" at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd` downloaded tons of 4K 240fps videos.

1. Turned off the "Wallpaper" feature in System Settings
2. Deleted the video files from the directory

Storage space recovered.
