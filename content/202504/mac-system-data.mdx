# Mac System Data

My Mac suddenly ran out of storage space. In the "System Settings" > "General" > "Storage", "System Data" was over 100GB.

Found the issue: "Wallpaper" at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd` downloaded tons of 4K 240fps videos.

1. Turn off the "Wallpaper" feature in System Settings, I set the pure black color as the wallpaper.
2. Delete these files

```sh
/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd/
/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TVIdleScreen/
${HOME}/Library/Application Support/com.apple.wallpaper/Store/Index.plist
```

3. Restart the Mac.

Storage space recovered.
