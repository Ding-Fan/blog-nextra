# company card

I want to create a web application. I want it be like a tinder(card deck), and each card is a company. The card can contain the key information of that company like name, logo, does it recruit. It can be viewed on desktop or mobile. If on mobile, use the swipe left and right logic like tinder. If on desktop, just show those cards like amazon showing products.

This application should use nextjs with tailwindcss. Use pnpm.

I also wish to show the opening job positions on the card, but it might be too much, so maybe just showing what position is activly recruiting. User can go into the detail of that card to see more.

I'll use supabase as the database backend. I use google gemini 2.5 with grounding to extract the important information from websites of those company or their recruiting page. I am also using Model Context Protocol (this is a new way to interactive with AI) to write those extracted data into the supabase.
