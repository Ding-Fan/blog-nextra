# アキバのバイト女王 - Complete Story Instruction Guide

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for the Japanese learning drama "アキバのバイト女王" (Akiba Part-time Job Queen), including formatting guidelines, component usage, and character information.

## Story Context

The story follows a foreign student working at a maid café in Akihabara, providing language learning opportunities through workplace interactions and cultural contexts. The narrative focuses on authentic language learning experiences, workplace communication, and cultural immersion.

### Plot Elements and Mysteries

**Important**: The story contains plot mysteries that should be revealed gradually:
