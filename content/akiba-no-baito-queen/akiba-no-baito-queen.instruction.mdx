# Instruction

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for the Japanese learning drama "アキバのバイト女王" (Akiba Part-time Job Queen), including formatting guidelines, component usage, and character information.

## Story Context

The story follows a foreign student working at a maid café in Akihabara, providing language learning opportunities through workplace interactions and cultural contexts. The narrative focuses on authentic language learning experiences, workplace communication, and cultural immersion.

### Plot Elements and Mysteries

**Important**: The story contains plot mysteries that should be revealed gradually:
- **店長's Smart Glasses**: He wears smart glasses hidden behind regular sunglasses and pretends to look at a smartphone mockup to conceal this technology. This should NOT be revealed by the narrator early - keep it as a discovery for later episodes.
- **Character Development**: Each episode should focus on specific learning challenges while building long-term character relationships.

### Episode Structure Guidelines

**Two-Scene Format**:
1. **First Scene**: Engaging hook with relatable content (e.g., shared experiences, workplace introduction)
2. **Second Scene**: Deep educational focus (language learning challenges, cultural insights)

**Pacing**:
- Keep individual dialogue exchanges short and natural
- Use multiple rounds of back-and-forth rather than long monologues
- Balance educational content with character development
