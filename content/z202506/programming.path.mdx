What are absolute paths and relative paths?


<Character name="sora" />

Relative is focusing on two things, like you and me.

For example:

<ProgrammingImage
    caption={'Scene 1'}
    src={"scene-1.png"}
/>

We are in **Building-A**

If you are in **Floor-3 Room-301**, I'm at **Floor-3**.

I would say "I'm **heading to** the **Room-301** to find you".


<Character name="hiro" />

I know the command `cd` in terminal means "**c**hange **d**irectory". It is like **heading to** . So you are saying `cd Room-301` .  


<Character name="sora" />

Yes, exactly!

<ProgrammingImage
    caption={'Scene 2'}
    src={"scene-2.png"}
/>

If you are at **Floor-3**, I'm in **Floor-3 Room-301**.

I would say "I'm **heading out** to find you".

We use `..`(double dots) to point to the "out" of the current place, so **heading out** is like `cd ..` in terminal.


<Character name="hiro" />

What if I'm in **Floor-5 Room-502** and you're in **Floor-3 Room-301** ?


<Character name="sora" />

<ProgrammingImage
    caption={'Scene 3'}
    src={"scene-3.png"}
/>

In that case, I would say "I'm **heading out** and **heading out** and **heading to Floor-5 Room-502** to find you."


<Character name="hiro" />

Why do you say **heading out** twice?

<Character name="sora" />

- I'm in **Floor-3 Room-301**
- I'm **heading out**, I'm at **Floor-3**.
- I'm **heading out**, I'm at **Building-A**
- then I'm **heading to** the **Floor-5 Room-502** to find you.


<Character name="hiro" />

Let me convert this to terminal command.

```bash
# You are in `Floor-3/Room-301`

cd ..
# now you are in `Floor-3`

cd ..
# now you are in `Building-A`

cd Floor-5/Room-502
# now you are in `Floor-5/Room-502`
```


<Character name="sora" />

Correct! Now you see me!


Follow the relative path from where I am to where you are, the command can be merged into one line:

```bash
# I'm in Floor-3/Room-301
# I heading out, heading out, heading to Floor-5/Room-502
cd ../../Floor-5/Room-502
```

As you know, in this case, `/` is used to separate the places.


<Character name="hiro" />

But I've learned that `/` means the **root directory** .


<Character name="sora" />

When nothing is before the `/`, it means the **root directory** .

Since you mentioned the **root directory**, let's talk about **absolute path** .

In the example above, both of us are in **Building-A**. I can follow relative path to find you quickly.

But what if we are in different buildings, different cities, or even different countries?

<ProgrammingImage
    caption={'Scene 4'}
    src={"scene-4.png"}
/>

Let's say you are in **Japan Tokyo Street-A Building-A Floor-1 Room-101**.

I'm in **France Paris Street-B Building-B Floor-2 Room-202**.

- I'm **heading out**, I'm at **France Paris Street-B Building-B Floor-2**.
- I'm **heading out**, I'm at **France Paris Street-B Building-B**.
- I'm **heading out**, I'm at **France Paris Street-B**.
- I...


<Character name="hiro" />


You will get lost if you keep going like that.


<Character name="sora" />

That's where absolute path comes in handy. I'll just teleport to you by `cd /Japan/Tokyo/Street-A/Building-A/Floor-1/Room-101` .


<Character name="hiro" />

Can you bring me a Croissant?


<Character name="sora" />

Do you remember what you learned today? Can you recap it?


<Character name="hiro" />

Nope.


<Character name="sora" />

Nope.


<Character name="haru" />

Let's recap!

- Relative paths are from where you are to where you want to go. It's easy when you want to go to nearby places, like from one room to another in the same building.
- Absolute paths always start from the root. It's like having a complete address to find a place, no matter where you are.
- `cd` is change directory, `..` is "out", and `/` is used to separate places in paths. 
- Oh, when nothing is before the `/`, it means the root directory. Absolute paths always start with `/`.

Want more? Well, well, well.

- `pwd` is print working directory, it shows your current location.
- `.` means the current directory, like saying "here I am".
- `~` means your home directory, like saying "my home".
- What do you have in your `~/Downloads` folder?
- the word "path", "directory", "folder" are often used interchangeably in computing, but they can have slightly different meanings depending on the context.
