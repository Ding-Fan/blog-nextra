# study in Japan

I've studied in IT 専門学校(college)a in Tokyo for almost a year. From my experience, school's education is far left behind from the industry acknowledged good practice. Our Java final exam was written on paper to answer questions on paper. Our frontend learning material was W3CSchool(not too bad, but I think MDN should be a better choice). Our CCNA course was totally "feed the duck" style, read the textbook and answer questions on  Excel方眼紙(grid paper) or printed handouts. I've chat with several students here, nearly nobody can learn anything from school's IT course, some of them have to take online tutorial like youtube or Coursera, some even paid for online courses in their native language(which I think is not an efficient way to study programming. I suffered a lot because awful Simplified Chinese translation of CS jargon, they always make the concepts more difficult to understand. For example: handler).

I'm a self-taught frontend developer ten years ago since in university, and I know many talented self-taught programmer way more younger than me. I was hugely helped by them on those online groups/forums. I'm also good with English reading, so there are sufficient online resources for me. I would and did share those resources with my classmates, but self-study is not for everyone, especially for those who have to take the school by the day and do part-time job all the night.
