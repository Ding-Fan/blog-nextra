# study in Japan

After spending almost a year in an IT 専門学校(college) in Tokyo, I’ve realized that the IT education here has nothing to do with today's programmer. The gap between what schools teach and what the industry (should?) demands is huge. Exams for Java were written on paper, frontend resource is W3School, which isn’t terrible, but MDN is the standard. Networking (CCNA) was all textbook reading and filling out worksheets, sometimes on Excel方眼紙(grid paper). There was no real hands-on experience, no actual application of what we were “learning.”

It’s no surprise that students struggle. Almost no one I’ve talked to felt like they learned anything useful in these courses. Some relied on YouTube tutorials, others paid for online courses in their own languages. But even that isn’t always effective—I’ve personally found that poorly translated CS jargon makes things even harder. For example, the Simplified Chinese translation 句柄(handler) confused me more than it helped.

I’ve always been a self-taught developer, starting ten years ago during university. I know how hard it can be to learn on your own, but I also know how much community and the right resources can help. I started sharing useful online resources with my classmates, but it quickly became clear that self-study doesn’t work for everyone. Many of my classmates were juggling full-time school and part-time jobs; they didn’t have the time or energy to figure everything out on their own.

So, I started hosting small teaching sessions after school twice a week. I’d invite classmates and explain concepts using the Feynman method—teaching others helps you learn better too. But there was only so much we could do in two hours a week. IT is such a broad field, covering frontend, backend, networking, and computer science basics, and it’s impossible to cover it all in a few sessions. On top of that, when new classmates join us, what I have prepared wouldn't apply to three person who has different levels of knowledge, I must find a better way.

I'm a self-taught frontend developer ten years ago since in university, and I know many talented self-taught programmer way more younger than me. I was hugely helped by them on those online groups/forums. I'm also good with English reading, so there are sufficient online resources for me. 

I thought about one thing that kept me motivated when learning something new -- game. I’ve drafted a board game to teach binary concepts. It starts with matching powers of 2 with the results, then introduces binary format, bytes, IP addresses, subnet masks, subnet and so on. The idea is to build understanding step-by-step, making the process enjoyable. I've implemented the powers of 2 matching game using paper cards, it received great feedback from my classmates. 

Alongside that, I’m working on bite-sized, mobile-friendly lessons that are easy to pick up even when you’re tired after work and class. There are existing successful examples like Duolingo, which gamifies learning and makes it feel less like a chore. Brilliant (thank you Kurzgesagt), which break complex topics in digestible pieces.  

Another idea is to create a system for tracking progress. Similar to DnD game, we can have challenge level like building a binary convertor or subnet calculator, to get the hands in dirts. Completed challenge could be verified by the creator(dungeon master!) and hosted on GitHub as Proof of Work—something students can show as a badge of achievement or even use when applying for jobs. I think achievement badges can tell more than a 2 hours interview with 500 characteristic quiz. Even if the employer insist, students can talk about the stories behind the badges.

Japan is a magical place that you don't need to be a genius to live a decent life and do what you want to do. Not everyone has the luxury of time or gift on web to learn IT in wild. That’s why I want to create tools that are engaging, flexible, and fit into busy lives. My hope is to make learning accessible not just for students in Japan but for anyone in the world who desire to learn, my ambition is to lift the Curse of Knowledge.

Also human nature is forget.

And I feel it's difficult to decide what knowledge point to teach when new classmates join us. It's difficult to teach IT practicing skills to people with different knowledge backgrounds. I'm considering create independent "from 0 to 0.1" courses to suit everyone's needs.

Game is always something get me addicted. Duolingo is a successful example of gamify studying. As a Duolingo user, the core value of it is providing a illusion of continuing study, which is precious for forming a habit of studying. I have some ideas of making studying materials that have interactive, soomth learning curve, instant feedback. For example, I have a draft of board game to get player familiar with binary. The entry level is matching game of power of 2 and its results. After that I'd introduce the binary format with "bit" cards, then the byte, then a valid ip address, then network mask and subnetwork etc. I want to create some learning resources bite size and mobile friendly and satisfying enough that even a mind tired from busy works and exhausting classes can enjoy. And a milestone could be simple projects like subnetwork calculator, player can do it alone or team up to make a website of it. Finally after verified by me (or some other dungeon master), the project can be hosted on GitHub as a badge, or a certificate, as Proof of Work.
