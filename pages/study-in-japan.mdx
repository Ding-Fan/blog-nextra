# study in Japan

I've studied in IT 専門学校(college)a in Tokyo for almost a year. From my experience, school's education is far left behind from the industry acknowledged good practice. Our Java final exam was written on paper to answer questions on paper. Our frontend learning material was W3CSchool(not too bad, but I think MDN should be a better choice). Our CCNA course was totally "feed the duck" style, read the textbook and answer questions on  Excel方眼紙(grid paper) or printed handouts. I've chat with several students here, nearly nobody can learn anything from school's IT course, some of them have to take online tutorial like youtube or Coursera, some even paid for online courses in their native language(which I think is not an efficient way to study programming. I suffered a lot because awful Simplified Chinese translation of CS jargon, they always make the concepts more difficult to understand. For example: handler).

I'm a self-taught frontend developer ten years ago since in university, and I know many talented self-taught programmer way more younger than me. I was hugely helped by them on those online groups/forums. I'm also good with English reading, so there are sufficient online resources for me. I would and did share those resources with my classmates, but self-study is not for everyone, especially for those who have to take the school by the day and do part-time job all the night.

I would and did share those resources with my classmates, but self-study is not for everyone, especially for those who have to take the school by the day and do part-time job all the night. I started to invite some classmates and teach them after school twice a week, it also benefits myself as Feynman method. Soon I realized that it helps but too little, how could a freshman master frontend, backend, network, computer science introduction, all those 4 courses by study only 2 hours a week? Also human nature is forget.

And I feel it's difficult to decide what knowledge point to teach when new classmates join us. It's difficult to teach IT practicing skills to people with different knowledge backgrounds. I'm considering create independent "from 0 to 0.1" courses to suit everyone's needs.

Game is always something get me addicted. Duolingo is a successful example of gamify studying. As a Duolingo user, the core value of it is providing a illusion of continuing study, which is precious for forming a habit of studying. I have some ideas of making studying materials that have interactive, soomth learning curve, instant feedback. For example, I have a draft of board game to get player familiar with binary. The entry level is matching game of power of 2 and its results. After that I'd introduce the binary format with "bit" cards, then the byte, then a valid ip address, then network mask and subnetwork etc. I want to create some learning resources bite size and mobile friendly and satisfying enough that even a mind tired from busy works and exhausting classes can enjoy. And a milestone could be simple projects like subnetwork calculator, player can do it alone or team up to make a website of it. Finally after verified by me (or some other dungeon master), the project can be hosted on GitHub as a badge, or a certificate, as Proof of Work.
