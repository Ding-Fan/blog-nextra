## idea

use blue for 1, black for 0

create website, input ip address and network mask 192.188.2.3/24, output network address, broadcast address, first host, last host, number of hosts. also show the binary of ip address and network mask to help understand the calculation, use the locked-bit animation.

is subnetwork like divide class students into groups?

what is network address, what does it do, what is the diference from network part

192.168.3.0/24

the ip address has two parts, the network part and the host part

the cidr notation is /24, which means the first 24 bits are network part, the rest 8 bits are host part

the first octet is 192, which belongs to class C, the default subnet mask is /24 , so no subnetworks are created

the network part is 192.168.3, the host part is 0

in binary, the network part is 11000000.10101000.00000011, the host part is 00000000

the cidr notation is /24, in binary, it is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

the 1 in the subnet mask defines the network part, the 0 defines the host part
