## Introduction

JAVA is a programming language, you can use it to command the machine works for you.

## Class and Main Method

3000 years ago, someone made a great clay figure. Today, we will make the clay figure great again, with JAVA.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }
}
```

I guess you can write down the code above on the paper with pencil and with your eyes closed.(Just kidding, for Java's sake don't do that.) But you might not know what you are doing, what have you created. Let's break it down.

You have created a `Class` . Just like the clay figure has head and body, so does the `Class` .

```java
public class ClayFigure // the HEAD
```

```java
{                                                   // everything
    public static void main(String[] args) {        // between the
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");  // curly braces
    }                                               // belongs to
}                                                   // the BODY
```

In the `Class` , the main `Method` also has head and body.

> The main() method is where your program starts running.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) // this is the HEAD
```

```java
{                                              // everything between
    System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!"); // the curly braces
}                                              // belongs to the BODY
```

## Define and Call Method

You don't know the main method is a `Method` ? Now you do. Let's **define** another `Method` . Remember? Head and Body.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }

    // new method here
    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

Now we have method `laugh` , which is `public static void` , and in its body, it prints out "ha". Let's **call** the `laugh` method in the `main` method.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

It seems our clay figure is happy, let's make it happier.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}

```

Yes, you can use name of the method followed by `()` to call the method. The `()` is called `parentheses` . You can put `arguments` inside the parentheses. Let's make the clay figure laugh 40 times...

You don't want to write `laugh();` 40 times? Of course. You can use a `loop` to do that.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        for (int i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
            laugh();
        }
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}

```

## Arguments and Parameters

Or we can make the method `laugh` smarter.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(40);
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }
}
```

That looks better. When we call the method, we passed an `argument` to the method. The `argument` is `40` . The `argument` is stored in the `parameter` named `timesOrWhatever` , which has type `int` . The `parameter` is like a variable, but it only exists in the method.

- When you **call** the method, the thing between the parentheses is the `argument` .
- When you **define** the method, the thing between the parentheses is the `parameter` .

Some of you might have realized that the `main` method has `String[] args` as its parameter. `String[]` means an array `[]` of strings `String` . `args` is the name of the parameter. You can name the parameter whatever you like.

## Overloading

Can we make the clay figure laugh with different sounds? Yes, we can.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");
    }


    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```

We have two `laugh` methods. The first one has one parameter, the second one has two parameters. The two methods have the same name, but different parameters. This is called `overloading` .

> A method is overloaded if there are multiple versions with the same name but different parameters.

## Return Type

But what is the `void` in `public static void` ?

It is the `return type` of the method. `void` means the method does not return anything. If the method returns something, you should replace `void` with the type of the thing it returns. For example, if the method returns a number, you should use `int` . If the method returns a string, you should use `String` .

When you go to a ramen restaurant, you are expecting a bowl of ramen. Same to the `return type` of the method.

Let's make methods to return the weight and height of the clay figure.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + weight());
        System.out.println("Height: " + height());
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }

    // https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/515725
    public static int weight() {
        return 1440;
    }

    public static double height() {
        return 34.2;
    }
}
```

- introduce the variable of the class, and use it in the method
