## Introduction

JAVA is a programming language, you can use it to command the machine works for you.

## Class and Main Method

3000 years ago, someone made a great clay figure. Today, we will make the clay figure great again, with JAVA.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }
}
```

I guess you can write down the code above on the paper with pencil and with your eyes closed.(Just kidding, for Java's sake don't do that.) But you might not know what you are doing, what have you created. Let's break it down.

You have created a `Class` . Just like the clay figure has head and body, so does the `Class` .

```java
public class ClayFigure // the HEAD
```

```java
{                                                   // everything
    public static void main(String[] args) {        // between the
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");  // curly braces
    }                                               // belongs to
}                                                   // the BODY
```

In the `Class` , the main `Method` also has head and body.

> The main() method is where your program starts running.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) // this is the HEAD
```

```java
{                                              // everything between
    System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!"); // the curly braces
}                                              // belongs to the BODY
```

## Define and Call Method

You don't know the main method is a `Method` ? Now you do. Let's **define** another `Method` . Remember? Head and Body.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }

    // new method here
    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

Now we have method `laugh` , which is `public static void` , and in its body, it prints out "ha". Let's **call** the `laugh` method in the `main` method.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

It seems our clay figure is happy, let's make it happier.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}

```

Yes, you can use name of the method followed by `()` to call the method. The `()` is called `parentheses` . You can put `arguments` inside the parentheses. Let's make the clay figure laugh 40 times...

You don't want to write `laugh();` 40 times? Of course. You can use a `loop` to do that.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        for (int i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
            laugh();
        }
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}

```

## Arguments and Parameters

Or we can make the method `laugh` smarter.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(40);
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }
}
```

That looks better. When we call the method, we passed an `argument` to the method. The `argument` is `40` . The `argument` is stored in the `parameter` named `timesOrWhatever` , which has type `int` . The `parameter` is like a variable, but it only exists in the method.

- When you **call** the method, the thing between the parentheses is the `argument` .
- When you **define** the method, the thing between the parentheses is the `parameter` .

Some of you might have realized that the `main` method has `String[] args` as its parameter. `String[]` means an array `[]` of strings `String` . `args` is the name of the parameter. You can name the parameter whatever you like.

## Overloading

Can we make the clay figure laugh with different sounds? Yes, we can.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");
    }


    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```

We have two `laugh` methods. The first one has one parameter, the second one has two parameters. The two methods have the same name, but different parameters. This is called `overloading` .

> A method is overloaded if there are multiple versions with the same name but different parameters.

## Return Type

But what is the `void` in `public static void` ?

It is the `return type` of the method. `void` means the method does not return anything. If the method returns something, you should replace `void` with the type of the thing it returns. For example, if the method returns a number, you should use `int` . If the method returns a string, you should use `String` .

When you go to a ramen restaurant, you are expecting a bowl of ramen. Same to the `return type` of the method.

Let's make methods to return the weight and height of the clay figure.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + weight());
        System.out.println("Height: " + height());
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }

    // https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/515725
    public static int weight() {
        return 1440;
    }

    public static double height() {
        return 34.2;
    }
}
```

The `weight` method returns an `int` , the `height` method returns a `double` . You can use the `return` keyword to return the value, remember to match the `return type` .

## Class Variable

There is another way to store the weight and height of the clay figure. You can use `class variable` .

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {

    // https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/515725
    public static int weight = 1440;
    public static double height = 34.2;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + ClayFigure.weight);
        System.out.println("Height: " + ClayFigure.height);
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```

You can access the `class variable` by using the `class name` followed by `.` and the `variable name` .

Do you know `Math.PI` ? It is a `class variable` in the `Math` class. You can access it by using `Math.PI` . Also `Integer.MAX_VALUE` , `Double.MIN_VALUE` , etc.

Let's print them out.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {

    public static int weight = 1440;
    public static double height = 34.2;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + ClayFigure.weight);
        System.out.println("Height: " + ClayFigure.height);

        System.out.println("PI: " + Math.PI);
        System.out.println("MAX_VALUE: " + Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        System.out.println("MIN_VALUE: " + Double.MIN_VALUE);
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```

Remove them after you see the output. The clay figure has nothing to do with `Math.PI` .

## Instance Variable

There is another way to store the weight and height of the clay figure. You can use `instance variable` .

Wait... What is `instance` ?

An `instance` is an object of a `class` . You can create multiple `instances` of a `class` . Each `instance` has its own `instance variable` .

You must have many questions in your head. What is a `Class` ? What is an `Object` ? What is an `Instance` ? What is the difference between `instance variable` and `class variable` ?

Calm down, let's make the clay figure great again.

<RichImage

  caption={"blueprint on the left, clay figure on the right"}
  src="images/blueprint-and-figure.png"
/>

To create an `instance` , you can use the `new` keyword followed by the `class name` and `()` .

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {

    public int weight = 1440; // instance variable
    public static double height = 34.2; // class variable

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClayFigure clayFigureAomori = new ClayFigure(); // create a clayFigureAomori because it is from 青森

        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + clayFigureAomori.weight); // access the instance variable from the instance
        System.out.println("Height: " + ClayFigure.height); // access the class variable from the class
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```
