## Introduction

JAVA is a programming language, you can use it to command the machine works for you.

## Class and Main Method

3000 years ago, someone made a great clay figure. Today, we will make the clay figure great again, with JAVA.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }
}
```

I guess you can write down the code above on the paper with pencil and with your eyes closed.(Just kidding, for Java's sake don't do that.) But you might not know what you are doing, what have you created. Let's break it down.

You have created a `Class` . Just like the clay figure has head and body, so does the `Class` .

```java
public class ClayFigure // the HEAD
```

```java
{                                                   // everything
    public static void main(String[] args) {        // between the
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");  // curly braces
    }                                               // belongs to
}                                                   // the BODY
```

In the `Class` , the main `Method` also has head and body.

> The main() method is where your program starts running.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) // this is the HEAD
```

```java
{                                              // everything between
    System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!"); // the curly braces
}                                              // belongs to the BODY
```

## Define and Call Method

You don't know the main method is a `Method` ? Now you do. Let's **define** another `Method` . Remember? Head and Body.

```java showLineNumbers {6-8} copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

Now we have method `laugh` , which is `public static void` , and in its body, it prints out "ha". Let's **call** the `laugh` method in the `main` method.

```java showLineNumbers {4} copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

It seems our clay figure is happy, let's make it happier.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}

```

Yes, you can use name of the method followed by `()` to call the method. The `()` is called `parentheses` . You can put `arguments` inside the parentheses. Let's make the clay figure laugh 40 times...

You don't want to write `laugh();` 40 times? Of course. You can use a `loop` to do that.

```java showLineNumbers {4-6} copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        for (int i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
            laugh();
        }
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}

```

## Arguments and Parameters

Or we can make the method `laugh` smarter.

```java showLineNumbers {4,7-11} copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(40);
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }
}
```

Todo: explain parameter in the method

Todo: explain i++

That looks better. When we call the method, we passed an `argument` to the method. The `argument` is `40` . The `argument` is stored in the `parameter` named `timesOrWhatever` , which has type `int` . The `parameter` is like a variable, but it only exists in the method.

- When you **call** the method, the thing between the parentheses is the `argument` .
- When you **define** the method, the thing between the parentheses is the `parameter` .

Some of you might have realized that the `main` method has `String[] args` as its parameter. `String[]` means an array `[]` of strings `String` . `args` is the name of the parameter. You can name the parameter whatever you like.

## Overloading

Can we make the clay figure laugh with different sounds? Yes, we can.

```java showLineNumbers {4-6,15-19} copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh(4);
        laugh(2, "he");
        laugh(1, "ho");
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```

We have two `laugh` methods. The first one has one parameter, the second one has two parameters. The two methods have the same name, but different parameters. This is called `overloading` .

> A method is overloaded if there are multiple versions with the same name but different parameters.

## Return Type

But what is the `void` in `public static void` ?

It is the `return type` of the method. `void` means the method does not return anything. If the method returns something, you should replace `void` with the type of the thing it returns. For example, if the method returns a number, you should use `int` . If the method returns a string, you should use `String` .

When you go to a ramen restaurant, you are expecting a bowl of ramen. Same to the `return type` of the method.

Let's make methods to return the weight and height of the clay figure.

```java copy
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + weight());
        System.out.println("Height: " + height());
    }

    // https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/515725
    public static int weight() {
        return 1440;
    }

    public static double height() {
        return 34.2;
    }
}
```

The `weight` method returns an `int` , the `height` method returns a `double` . You can use the `return` keyword to return the value, remember to match the `return type` .

## Class and Instance and Object

- Class: The blueprint of the clay figure.
- Object: The clay figure.
- Instance: Same as object. Usually used to say "This object is an instance of that class".

<RichImage
  classNameImg="w-full md:w-80"
  caption={"blueprint on the left, clay figure on the right"}
  src="images/blueprint-and-figure.png"
/>

When you have a blueprint(class), you can create as many clay figure(instance) as you want. To create an `instance` , you can use the `new` keyword followed by the `class name` and `()` .

```java
ClayFigure clayFigureAomori = new ClayFigure();
// the ClayFigure on the left is the type of the variable
// when you create a class, you are also creating a new type
// clayFigureAomori is the variable name, because it is from 青森
```

As long as you have the blueprint, you can create as many clay figures as you want.

## Class Variable: use keyword static

There is another way to store the weight and height of the clay figure. You can use `class variable` .

Todo: explain where to put the class variable

```java showLineNumbers {3-5,10-11} copy
public class ClayFigure {

    // https://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/515725
    public static int weight = 1440;
    public static double height = 34.2;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + ClayFigure.weight);
        System.out.println("Height: " + ClayFigure.height);
    }
}
```

You can access the `class variable` by using the `class name` followed by `.` and the `variable name` .

Do you know `Math.PI` ? It is a `class variable` in the `Math` class. You can access it by using `Math.PI` . Also `Integer.MAX_VALUE` , `Double.MIN_VALUE` , etc.

Let's print them out.

```java showLineNumbers {12-14} copy
public class ClayFigure {

    public static int weight = 1440;
    public static double height = 34.2;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");

        System.out.println("Weight: " + ClayFigure.weight);
        System.out.println("Height: " + ClayFigure.height);

        System.out.println("PI: " + Math.PI);
        System.out.println("MAX_VALUE: " + Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        System.out.println("MIN_VALUE: " + Double.MIN_VALUE);
    }
}
```

Todo: explain why can use Math.PI etc, because of java.lang . also String

Todo: explain scientific notation in Double.MIN_VALUE

## Instance Variable: without keyword static

There is another way to store the weight and height of the clay figure. You can use `instance variable` .

Todo: explain where to put the instance variable

Todo: explain local variable doesn't have modifier

```java showLineNumbers {3-4,8,12-16} copy
public class ClayFigure {

    public int weight = 1440; // instance variable
    public static double height = 34.2; // class variable

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ClayFigure clayFigureAomori = new ClayFigure();

        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");

        // access the instance variable from the instance clayFigureAomori
        System.out.println("Weight: " + clayFigureAomori.weight);

        // access the class variable from the class ClayFigure
        System.out.println("Height: " + ClayFigure.height);
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```

Todo: compare class variable, instance variable with local variable in the method

`static` can also be used for `method` , so there are `class method` and `instance method` .

## Access Modifier

```java
public int weight = 1440; // public: everyone can access it
int age = 3000; // default: all the class in current package can access it
protected String name = "Clay Figure"; // protected: same to default, and its subclasses can access it
private double height = 34.2; // private: only accessible within the class
```

Let's create a `mypackage` folder and put file `ClayFigure.java` and `Box.java` in it.

```java filename="mypackage/ClayFigure.java" showLineNumbers copy
package mypackage;

public class ClayFigure {

    private int weight = 1440;
    protected double height = 34.2;
    public String name = "Clay Figure";
    int age = 3000;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println("ha");
        }
    }

    public static void laugh(int timesOrWhatever, String sound) {
        for (int i = 0; i < timesOrWhatever; i++) {
            System.out.println(sound);
        }
    }
}
```

```java filename="mypackage/Box.java" showLineNumbers copy
package mypackage;

public class Box {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    ClayFigure ClayFigureInstance = new ClayFigure();

    System.out.print("There is a ");
    System.out.println(ClayFigureInstance.name);

    System.out.print("The age is ");
    System.out.println(ClayFigureInstance.age);
    System.out.print("The height is ");
    System.out.println(ClayFigureInstance.height);

    // uncomment the following line and see the error
    // comment it back then
    // System.out.println(ClayFigureInstance.weight);


  }
}
```

When you meet someone, you allow them to access your name(which is public), but not your bank account password(which is private).
