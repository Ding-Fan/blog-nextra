3000 years ago, someone made a great clay figure. Today, we will make the clay figure great again, with JAVA.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }
}
```

I guess you can write down the code above on the paper with pencil and with your eyes closed.(Just kidding, for Java's sake don't do that.) But you might not know what you are doing, what have you created. Let's break it down.

You have created a `Class` . Just like the clay figure has head and body, so does the `Class` .

```java
public class ClayFigure // the HEAD
```

```java
{                                                   // everything
    public static void main(String[] args) {        // between the
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");  // curly braces
    }                                               // belongs to
}                                                   // the BODY
```

In the `Class` , the main `Method` also has head and body.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) // this is the HEAD
{                                              // everything between
    System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!"); // the curly braces
}                                              // belongs to the BODY
```

You don't know the main method is a `Method` ? Now you do. Let's create another `Method`.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
    }

    // new method here
    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

Now we have method `laugh` , which is `public static void` , and in its body, it prints out "ha". Let's call the `laugh` method in the `main` method.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}
```

It seems our clay figure is happy, let's make it happier.

```java
public class ClayFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, clay figure!");
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
        laugh();
    }

    public static void laugh() {
        System.out.println("ha");
    }
}

```
