## format data for quiz

```txt copy
**Context:**
I have some question data (including question text, answer options, the correct answer(s), and any notes/explanations). I want to format each question into the following JavaScript/TypeScript object scheme:

{
  id: number,
  question: string,
  options: string[],
  correctAnswers: number[], // zero-based indices (e.g., [0, 2] if there are two correct answers)
  note: string
}

**My Requirements:**
1. Each question must become one object in an array.
2. `id` should be a unique integer, incrementing from the last used ID (I'll specify the starting ID if needed).
3. `question` should be the full text of the question or prompt.
4. `options` is an array of the possible answers (strings). 
5. `correctAnswers` is an array of zero-based indices indicating the correct choice(s). If only one answer is correct, include it as a single-element array (e.g., `[1]`).
6. `note` contains any explanation or commentary.

---

**Instructions:**
1. I will now provide raw questions and answers in plain text or bullet points.
2. Please parse them carefully.
3. Output a JavaScript array of objects, each matching the scheme above.
4. Use zero-based indexing in `correctAnswers`.
5. Include my notes/explanations in the `note` field if present.

---

**Example of the Desired Output Format:**

[
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "最近の映画には、映画館に足を運んで鑑賞する（ ）ものがないと父は嘆く",
    options: ["とする", "にたえる", "にたえない", "としない"],
    correctAnswers: [1],
    note: ""
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "このレストランの料理は、おいしいのはもちろんのこと、盛り付けも美しくて、芸術的（）",
    options: ["というところだ", "といったらない", "ですらある", "極まりない"],
    correctAnswers: [2],
    note: ""
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "けんちゃん、これおいしいから食べて（）",
    options: ["ごらん", "あげて", "もらいなさい", "いただいて"],
    correctAnswers: [0],
    note: ""
  }
]
