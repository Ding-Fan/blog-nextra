# prompt market

I want to create a prompt marketplace based on a browser extension.

The core functionality will allow users to quickly input prompts into any text field on a webpage using the extension.

Additionally, there will be a dedicated page for searching, publishing, and editing prompts.

ChatGPT’s "My GPTs" and the GPT Store are similar to Apple’s App Store, Android’s Play Store, and Xiaomi’s App Market.

My idea is akin to a universal third-party GPT application marketplace.
