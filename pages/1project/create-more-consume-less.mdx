当全球疫情第一次被宣告时，人们开始困惑。它很可怕，但是，也有点刺激--一种全新的体验，至少。

所以剩下的一整年里--抛开心伤与诀别--我们得以享受慢节奏的远程生活。而今，近一年之后，精神上，情感上，身体上的损伤也已显现。我们经受打击，只剩疲惫。

新年突至，我以为暂停创造性的工作，“更多的体会生活”会给我充能--然而并没有，我反而无精打采。内心的空虚像滚雪球一样与日俱增。

如果你发现自己对未来感到越来越疲惫和焦虑，科学研究表明，无论你的艺术经验或才能如何，一次专注的45分钟创造性活动可以显著降低你体内的皮质醇水平，从而减少你的整体压力。

换句话说，每天来一点创造性活动有好处。它可以帮助我们更加专注于当下，减少焦虑，感到充实。随着我继续了解创造力对心理健康的益处，我意识到每天写点儿东西这样简单的习惯，已然提升了我的自我认同，给了我一种使命感，并形成了情绪释放的缓冲区。

## 过度消费的问题

当今 21 世纪，你有太多事可以去做，可以去填满一天的每一个小时。你可以一口气追完整部剧。你可以下单一堆东西并当日送货上门。在算法的恩赐下，你可以划手机划过数不尽的时间，却也只能划过社交娱乐这三千弱水中的一瓢。

这样一周一月一年又一年，你开始明白为什么人们会变得无所作为，会落入这无休止的内容消费陷阱。

你看，生活是该被体验被享受，但这并不是生活的终极目的。终极目的是什么？是活着，是尽你所能做好的事情。你的终极目的是不断长大，不断进化。就是这么简单。

拉尔夫我耳朵爱默生（Ralph Waldo Emerson）说得好啊：

> 生活的目的不是为了快乐。而是为了有用，有荣誉，有同情心，为了让你的生活能带来变化，为了好好活。

享受用知识和技能武装自己的过程，并善加利用，为社会添砖加瓦，幸福在这旅程之中。幸福就来了。

而过度消费的问题是，它掏空了我们的内心。好笑的是它也创造了某些东西：一个巨大空洞。

你感觉被束缚了，活不会了。你失去了对习惯的掌控，失去了对情绪的控制，最终，这些能量的丧失让生产力归零。

**过度消费导致生活逃避主义。** 你没有学习如何面对自己的情绪，探索内心世界，并通过艺术进行自我表达，你找孟婆要迷魂汤去了。

消费的另一个问题是，它给你一种在做事的错觉。花几个小时看健身视频并不能让你变得健康，还是得起来动动。花几个小时看烹饪节目也不会使你成为更好的厨师——亲自下厨才会。

知道这些以后，你得做决断了：你是想通过创造与自我表达来定义你的生活，还是屈服于没头脑的内容消费？是无私地给予，还是自私地索取？正如马丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）曾经曰过的：“每个人都必须决定，行走于创造又利他的光明之中，还是在自毁且自私的黑暗下苟且。”

Creativity is Your Duty, But it Can Also Be a Therapeutic Tool

Art is the most beautiful form of human expression. Whether it be through prose, science, technology, innovation, visual arts, or illustration, the sheer act of living in a state of wonder and creation is what makes us human. 

When we create, we enter a state of flow, and flow is what psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihály defines as a state of complete immersion in an activity for its own sake. In his book, Flow: The psychology of optimal experience, he writes:

    “Flow is a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”

There’s a distinct word here that I should highlight. Notice how he says enjoyable and not pleasurable because they’re two different things.

Activities like eating, drinking, sleeping, and watching entertainment, are examples of pleasurable experiences. They’re passive and transient in nature. Enjoyable experiences, on the other hand, are active. Think of sports, writing, and art—they demand you to show up to it and be fully immersed in it. 

In other words: Pleasurable experiences are rooted in consumption. Enjoyable experiences are rooted in creation.

And this relates to what Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet, philosopher, and the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize, wrote somewhere between the 19th and 20th century:

    “I slept and dreamt that life was joy. 
    I awoke and saw that life was duty. 
    I worked—and behold, duty was joy.”

Work is duty and “duty is joy.” 

That’s one great mantra to live by. Duty is not pleasure; duty is joy. Duty is not consumption; duty is creation. And since creativity is a form of work and work is a duty, then creativity is a duty—a joy. 

When I sit down on my chair to write, I face a lot of resistance, but I insist on carrying myself through because the simple practice of plucking thoughts from the garden of my mind and glazing them in words gives me a sense of peace and calm. It arms me with joy. Hours flash by in minutes. The focus drifts me away from my worries of the future and returns me to the present. 

And after I walk away from my desk, the knowledge that I just painted an entire white page with black ink—that I’ve done something good today—graces me with the freedom to feel fulfilled. 

Writing is my art of choice, and it helps me make sense of my life, but as this published study on the connection between art and healing demonstrates, any form of art can help you improve your mental and emotional wellbeing. 

When you focus on one activity and become fully absorbed by it, your heart rate slows and your breath deepens. This immersive nature of being creative helps you control what thoughts you pay attention to. In a way, creative work transforms into a form of meditation.

But what makes it all worthwhile? The sense of accomplishment you feel by the end of it. Even if no one else checks out your work, it’ll still help you see yourself in a new light and earn your own appreciation. The artistic process of self-express helps you understand yourself better. And if you ask me, that’s the single most potent benefit of having your own creative outlet.

In fact, that’s why in the field of psychotherapy, they utilize the creative process to help people explore self-expression and, in doing so, find new ways to gain personal insight and develop more robust coping skills. It’s called art therapy. 

How to Tip The Scale Toward Creation

In her book, Big Magic, Elizabeth Gilbert writes that “a creative life is an amplified life. It’s a bigger life, a happier life, an expanded life, and a hell of a lot more interesting life. Living in this manner—continually and stubbornly bringing forth the jewels that are hidden within you—is a fine art, in and of itself.” I love that, and I couldn’t agree more.

Truth is, it doesn't take much to live a creative life. You don’t need to quit your job. You don’t need to move to a new place to feel inspired. You don’t need to sign-up for a $1,000 course to learn how to to make art.

You just need to start. 

And you just need to tip the scale toward creation.

Here’s a simple 3-step strategy to help you get started:

    Choose something you enjoy. Not something that gives you pleasure—something you enjoy. Something that pulls you in. Whether it be writing, drawing, designing, knitting, or baking, you’re only able to enter a state of flow when you do something for its own sake rather than an extrinsic reward. When the work is the reward—that’s what it means to enjoy it. 

    Block time for it, show up to it and say “no” to protect it. Set aside an hour a day for creativity. Switch off your phone. Create an interruption-free space. Say no to whatever or whoever pulls you in another direction. And if you can’t commit to a daily practice, can you do it twice per week?

    Leave your judgment at the door and replace it with self-compassion. Seriously. Remember that growth is a process. Good things take time to bloom. What keeps you growing, however, is your ability to suspend your critical judgment, honor your creative work, and be compassionate with yourself. You’re more capable than you think.

A New Mantra to Live By

Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson once these words:

    "Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant." 

In other words, don’t judge each day by what you consume but by what you create. Create more, consume less. That’s a good mantra to live by. 

I won't judge each day by what I consume, but by what I create.

I think you should too.
