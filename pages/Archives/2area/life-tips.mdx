# life tips

## washing long hair

When washing long hair, use a small amount of shampoo twice. Apply the shampoo, massage your hair, rinse, and then repeat.

If you use a lot of shampoo at once, it becomes difficult to massage your hair properly, making you feel like rinsing it out quickly. This can leave your hair feeling sticky.

## buying garbage bags

When buying garbage bags, purchase two sizes. One should be the size you feel is perfect, and the other should be a larger size. The larger size is for when you have more garbage than usual, so you won't struggle to choose the "perfect" size.

## buying things in DAISO

Always check where the item was made. Prefer products made in Japan or Korea, especially when they are the same price as others.
