# how to survive in japan college

Self study from the textbook. Most of the knowledge you need can be self learned from the textbook. If you have a textbook not match to your level, you can always use the internet to find any resources you need, oh, and there is also AI(ChatGPT) in the help.

Learn from English whenever you can, unless you are studying Japanese specific topics. You won't want to remember all those illogical katakana term and find the English origin later, unless you know what you are doing.

Most of the teacher are working hard and even sacrifice their personal time to teach, but don't expect that they will teach in a way you can understand. This is a complex question, includes society background and individual difference. If you've met a teacher speaks in your way, that's 一期一会 . You both are lonely soul dying inside but revived by each other in this magical land. Do your best to learn.

If you found that your teacher is difficult to understand, remember: Teacher is no more than a native Japanese speaker. You shouldn't expect too much to others just like to yourself. Behave yourself and they will be nice to you. As for study, it's your job, not theirs.

If you had conflict between your teacher, don't expect the school stands with you. The school only want stable, just like every traditional Japanese organization. If you are challenging the authority, you will be the enemy of the authority, you will be eliminated by any means. What you are facing is not an individual, but a system. Study 明治維新 again and face the fact: people dies in the revolution. Don't die in vain.
