## JsNumberThousandsSeparator

> For ease of reading, numbers with many digits may be divided into groups using a delimiter, such as comma "," or dot ".", half-space (or thin space) " ", space " ", underbar "_" (as in maritime "21_450") or apostrophe «'». [^1]

目前使用的方案是 `Number.prototype.toLocaleString()` [^2]

```ts
const number = 3500;

console.log(number.toLocaleString()); // "3,500" if in U.S. English locale
```

options 可以控制小数位数、有效位数 [^3]
