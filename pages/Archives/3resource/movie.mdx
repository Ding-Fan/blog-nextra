## 怪物

我看完《怪物》时的感受：

- 安藤桜这个单亲妈妈很到位，对外就像猫妈妈一样护子狂魔，对内又很东亚特色“愿你普通结婚生子”。

- 永山瑛太竟然演谁是谁了，渐渐从角色里看不到演员本人了，快要出神入化了。（在之后同样和坂本裕二合作的一部电影里，我都怀疑自己是不是看错了，最后确认了演员表是瑛太）

- 坂元裕二这种伏线写法在电影的时长限制里还是有些施展不开。里面小女孩给老师打报告的情节一下把我扯回孩童时代了。

- 选题刻板守旧（校园霸凌）却又前沿大胆，从小人物的生活里体现社会问题，很日本。

- 从身边统计学来看，这个议题就在身边。

What were your thoughts on Joaquin Phoenix's performance?

I think his performance is good. This is the first time that I've seen him in a movie. His laugh in this movie feels so natural, it is what the character would do. And his facial expressions are also very real. It is a immersive experience to watch this movie, to see a life and the society.

Did you feel that the film's portrayal of societal issues was effective or problematic?

I think the film expressed that the society is bipolar, and the higher class have been ignored the lower class for a long time. Lower class like Arthur himself, suffering from the society, hoping to be saved, picked up by the higher class. If the society keeps going its way, lower class have to take violence to survive. I don't know what is justice in this movie, everyside is chasing their own interests. This film did drew the attention of the world, but the violence end makes scared me. People are easy to be influenced by movies. 

How did the movie's atmosphere and setting impact your viewing experience?

It was dark and heavy. I don't know why Arthur killed his mother, maybe he saw the files and realized her mother adopted him. But I can't assume those files are real. Maybe I misunderstand, please clarify it for me. Also the final scene, why Arthur killed the woman staff? Is it showing that Arthur do has mental illness that he wil kill people without reasons? Or he saw something from the woman and decided to kill her? Please explain it to me.


What are your thoughts on the controversy surrounding the film's depiction of violence?

I don't like the violence in the movie, but I can't say that it a bad movie.
