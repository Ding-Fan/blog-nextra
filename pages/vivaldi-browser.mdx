## Reassigning `Ctrl + P` for Quick Tab Switching

By default, Ctrl + P in Vivaldi is set to the print command. To repurpose it for switching tabs, follow these steps:

- Open Vivaldi and navigate to **Settings -> Keyboard**
- In the **Window** section:
    - Find the Print option and remove the `Ctrl + P` shortcut.
    - Find Quick Commands and assign `Ctrl + P` to it.

Once configured, you can use `Ctrl + P` to quickly access open tabs via Quick Commands.

## Customizing Vivaldi's Interface with CSS and JavaScript

Vivaldi allows users to modify its user interface by editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Below are the steps to add custom styles and scripts.

### Locate the Vivaldi window.html File

To apply custom modifications, you need to edit the `window.html` file located in Vivaldi's installation directory. The typical file path is:

```
<YOURVIVALDIDIRECTORY>\Application\<VERSION>\resources\vivaldi
```

For example, on Windows:

```
C:\Users\my_user_name\AppData\Local\Vivaldi\Application\6.9.3447.54\resources\vivaldi\
```

Create a folder named `for-vivaldi` in the `vivaldi` directory. Create `custom.css` and `custom.js` files in this folder.

### Backup and Edit window.html

- Backup the `window.html` file before making any changes. For example, copy and paste it.
- Open `window.html` in a text editor.
- edit it to look like [this](https://github.com/Ding-Fan/for-vivaldi/blob/main/window.html)

### Inspect and Modify Vivaldi's UI

To inspect the Vivaldi user interface and identify elements for customization:

- Enter `vivaldi://inspect/#apps` into the address bar, press enter.
- Click `inspect` of Vivaldi `window.html` to begin inspecting UI elements.

### Add a Restart Button to the Toolbar

To create a restart button in the toolbar:

- Set `vivaldi://restart` as the homepage.
- If you don't have it, add a Home button to the toolbar via **Menu -> View -> Customize Toolbar**
- In your `custom.css`, add the [following code](https://forum.vivaldi.net/post/505882) to style the restart button:

```css filename="custom.css" copy 
button.ToolbarButton-Button[title*="Homepage (Alt+Home)"] svg path {
  d: path(
    "M9 12l-4.463 4.969-4.537-4.969h3c0-4.97 4.03-9 9-9 2.395 0 4.565.942 6.179 2.468l-2.004 2.231c-1.081-1.05-2.553-1.699-4.175-1.699-3.309 0-6 2.691-6 6h3zm10.463-4.969l-4.463 4.969h3c0 3.309-2.691 6-6 6-1.623 0-3.094-.65-4.175-1.699l-2.004 2.231c1.613 1.526 3.784 2.468 6.179 2.468 4.97 0 9-4.03 9-9h3l-4.537-4.969z"
  );
  transform: scale(0.9) !important;
  transform-origin: 157% 154% !important;
}
```

### Make the (left)TabBar auto hide

{
<div className="flex justify-center pt-4 pb-2">
  <video className="w-72" controls muted>
    <source src="https://pub-d73fbea1d5a74032a6bef88df97b73f2.r2.dev/Recording%202024-10-24%20210145.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>
}

Set the Tab Bar to the left and drag to adjust its width to the minimum.

You can use `custom.css` and `custom.js` from [this repo](https://github.com/Ding-Fan/for-vivaldi/tree/main/for-vivaldi)

Restart Vivaldi to apply your customizations. You should now see an **arrow button** above the Workspaces button, which allows you to toggle the auto-hide feature.

If your vivaldi updated, all those custom file will be overwritten. So, you need to backup and reapply them.
